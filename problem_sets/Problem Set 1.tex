\begin{enumerate}

	\item Suppose the market demand curve for a product is given by 
	$$
		Q^D_{mkt} = 1000 - 10P
	$$
	
	and the market supply curve is given by
	$$
		Q^S_{mkt} = -50 + 25P
	$$
	\begin{enumerate}
    \item What are the equilibrium price and quantity
    
    \item What is the inverse form of the demand curve?
  \end{enumerate}
  
  \newpage 
  \item Suppose that the individual demand curves for two individuals are given by
  $$
    Q^D_1 = \begin{cases} 
      200 - 10P & \text{if } P \leq 20 \\ 
      0         & \text{otherwise} 
    \end{cases}
    \quad\text{ and }\quad
    Q^D_2 = \begin{cases} 
      100 - 10P & \text{if } P \leq 10 \\ 
      0         & \text{otherwise} 
    \end{cases}
  $$
  and that the supply curve for the firm is given by
  $$
    Q^S_{mkt} = \begin{cases} 
      20P - 100 & \text{if } P \geq 5 \\ 
      0         & \text{otherwise} 
    \end{cases}.
  $$
  Find the market equilibrium (keeping in mind that the market price may be such that only 1 consumer will be willing to stay in the market).

  \item Suppose that when Snarfburger originally charged a price of $\$5$ for their burger, they sold $1,000$ burgers per week. Thinking that they could potentially make more money by charging a higher price, they raised their price by $50$ cents. After raising their price, they sold $800$
  units per week. 
  
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Find the price elasticity of demand for Snarfburgers. 
    
    \item Write a sentence interpreting the price elasticity of demand you calculated.
  \end{enumerate}

  \item With peanut butter on the $x$-axis, and jelly on the $y$-axis, draw a set of at least two indifference curves to represent the following types of preferences:

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item I like both peanut butter and jelly, and always get the same additional satisfaction froman ounce of peanut butter as I do from 2 ounces of jelly.
    \item I like peanut butter, but neither like nor dislike jelly.
    \item I like peanut butter, but dislike jelly.
    \item I like peanut butter and jelly, but I only want 2 ounces of peanut butter for every ounce of jelly.
